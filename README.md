we will create Virtual Keyboard using ReactJS. This project basically implements functional components and manages the state accordingly.
Users can interact with the virtual keyboard by clicking on keys, and the interface will respond accordingly, allowing for a seamless typing experience.
The keypress and character input logic are implemented using JS.
